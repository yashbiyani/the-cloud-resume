## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the [AWS Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), a hands-on project designed to help showcase cloud skills. My portfolio is built with modern frontend technologies and deployed using a robust cloud architecture on AWS, demonstrating my skills in both web development and cloud infrastructure.

## üìã Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations and transitions enhanced with Framer Motion
- **Dynamic Content**: Project showcase, skills and certification displays
- **Visitor Counter**: Tracks and displays site visitors using AWS backend
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatically adapts to system preferences

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project implements a serverless architecture on AWS following the Cloud Resume Challenge requirements:

```
                      +-------------------+
                      |    Route 53       |
                      | (DNS Management)  |
                      +-------------------+
                              |
                              | Custom Domain
                              v
                      +-------------------+
                      |  CloudFront       |
                      | (CDN with HTTPS)  |
                      +-------------------+

                              | Static Content Delivery
                              v
                      +-------------------+
                      |       S3          |
                      | (Website Hosting) |
                      +-------------------+
                              |
                              | API Calls
                              v
  +-------------------+  +-------------------+  +-------------------+
  |    API Gateway    |->|  Lambda Function  |->|     DynamoDB      |
  | (REST Endpoints)  |  | (Visitor Counter) |  | (Data Persistence)|
  +-------------------+  +-------------------+  +-------------------+
           ^                                            |
           |                                            |
           +--------------------------------------------+
                          Response Data
```

The Cloud Resume Challenge pushes you beyond typical frontend development into cloud operations:

1. **Frontend (S3)**: Static resume website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
2. **Content Delivery (CloudFront)**: Global distribution with HTTPS security
3. **Domain Management (Route 53)**: Custom domain configuration and DNS management
4. **Backend (Lambda & DynamoDB)**: Serverless visitor counter function with database persistence
5. **API Layer (API Gateway)**: Secure REST endpoints for frontend-backend communication
6. **DevOps (GitHub Actions)**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
7. **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS resources defined and managed through code

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: UI component library
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling

### Backend
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless function for visitor counter
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing visitor count
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints
- **S3**: Static website hosting
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery network
- **Route 53**: DNS management
- **Certificate Manager**: SSL/TLS certificates

### DevOps
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **AWS CLI**: Infrastructure automation
- **AWS SDK**: Programmatic access to AWS services

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment:

1. **Automated Testing**: Runs tests on code changes
2. **Build Process**: Compiles and bundles the application
3. **S3 Deployment**: Pushes built files to S3 bucket
4. **CloudFront Invalidation**: Ensures the newest content is served to visitors

## üìù Implementation Details

### Frontend
- Single-page application built with React and TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Interactive animations with Framer Motion
- Optimized for performance and accessibility

### Backend
- Lambda function to handle visitor counter API
- DynamoDB table to persistently store visitor count
- API Gateway configured with CORS support

### Infrastructure
- S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
- CloudFront distribution for global content delivery
- Domain configuration with Route 53
- SSL/TLS certificate for secure HTTPS connection

## üß† What I Learned

- Building serverless applications on AWS
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Managing infrastructure as code
- Implementing secure and scalable web applications
- Optimizing website performance and user experience

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- AWS CLI (configured with appropriate credentials)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yashbiyani/the-cloud-resume.git
cd the-cloud-resume

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

The project is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch. To manually deploy:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to AWS (requires AWS CLI and credentials)
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```
